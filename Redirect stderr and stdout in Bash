do_something 2>&1 | tee -a some_file



You can redirect stderr to stdout and the stdout into a file:

some_command >file.log 2>&1 


# Close STDOUT file descriptor
exec 1<&-
# Close STDERR FD
exec 2<&-

# Open STDOUT as $LOG_FILE file for read and write.
exec 1<>$LOG_FILE

# Redirect STDERR to STDOUT
exec 2>&1

echo "This line will appear in $LOG_FILE, not 'on screen'"
